# **README – Quantum Computation & Gravity Model (Phase 1 & 2\)**

### **Author: Rajvir Singh (Rajvir Randhawa)**

### **Date: March 6, 2025**

## **Overview**

This repository contains **Phase 1 & Phase 2** of a groundbreaking model unifying **Quantum Computation** and **Quantum Gravity**. These two phases lay the foundation for **a new approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing, entropy-based error correction, and a quantum-classical framework that fundamentally redefines how quantum information interacts with spacetime.**

**Phases 3 & 4 exist but are not included in this repository** for security and intellectual property protection. They extend the framework into advanced applications, real-world implementation, and experimental validation.
